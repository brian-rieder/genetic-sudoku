A genetic algorithm approach to solving a Sudoku puzzle

A simple Sudoku puzzle solver that employs evoluationary algorithms as a means to solve the puzzle.

This implementation is by no means efficient and was done as an exercise to demonstrate the power of mutation
and crossover in a population to coverge to a final solution. If you choose to run this, I would advise using 
a debugger and watching the puzzles evolve. The `pretty_print` function in a for loop as an adaptation would 
be a good choice for any curious minds.
